# 21DaySmartContractChallenge
21 days of learning to code solidity smart contracts

This respository contains 10 smart contracts each with their own problem statement
and if possible, a remix recorded video of the smart contract functioning.

We have tried to create the problem statements such that they encompass 
all levels(beginner, intermediate and advanced).

You can join this challenge at any point in time. The solutions will be posted on our Blockchain Slack group which will require you to join our Slack group in order to access the solutions :)

ALL THE BEST!
